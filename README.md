## About LilyPond and MuseScore.
LilyPond and MuseScore are the two most interesting open source projects dedicated to music notation.

LilyPond is a markup language, compatible with LaTeX (I refer you to this my article on LaTeX and LilyPond for writing text and music), that allows you to write musical scores of high graphical quality using text characters.

This feature makes it, among other things, also usable by AI systems, such as ChatGPT, to write autogenerated scores.

MuseScore has recently reached version 4 with many new features and updates in both visual and audio aspects.

The automatic musical rendition of its scores is such that it is comparable with actual interpretations.

However, this is not an article comparing the two systems: ideally, it is best to know them both.

But there is a problem: you may need to transfer scores from one application to the other to avoid having to rewrite all the work from scratch.

## Import / Export music files between lilypond and Musescore
[Guide to import/export music files between lilypond and musescore using Audiveris](https://francopasut.netlify.app/post/lilypond_musescore_musicxml/)  
The transfer from MusicXML and LilyPond is done without any problem thanks to the direct conversion feature from MuseScore to the MusicXML interchange format and the corresponding LilyPond import feature via musicxml2ly.

Transferring from LilyPond to MusicXML, on the other hand, is problematic because there is, to date, no export function from LilyPond to the same interchange format mentioned above.

The most reliable solution, at present, is the optical reading of the PDF score generated by LilyPond through the open-source software Audiveris in the original version, not the reduced version contained in Frescobaldi.
